# Overflow Identity

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/76e6370f-9d39-4036-882f-8f25b9b1d5f0/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/overflow-identity/deploys)

When I redesigned [my personal website](https://setu.me) in early 2016, I combined HTML5UP's [Overflow](https://web.archive.org/web/20210223162921/https://html5up.net/overflow) and [Identity](https://web.archive.org/web/20201027205452/https://html5up.net/identity) themes <sup id="html5up">[1](#html5up)</sup>. See an example of this theme in action [here](https://setu4993.github.io/overflow-identity/example).

<a name="html5up">[1]</a>: Above links are from Wayback Machine since the source pages, [Overflow](https://html5up.net/overflow) and [Identity](https://html5up.net/identity), have been non-functional for at least a few months.

Viewable on [Netlify](https://overflow-identity.netlify.app) and [GitHub Pages](https://setu4993.github.io/overflow-identity/example).
